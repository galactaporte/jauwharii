This blog is for any parent/ teacher who are interested to conduct classes/ programs primarily for home-schooled children. Currently it allows...

1. a new homeschool to register itself
2. to post program(s) that it wishes to conduct
3. general user to view the list of participating homeschools
4. and the events that they conduct

The app is hosted on heroku and we use mongodb for the database and to store image files for the event promo. Future addition to the app will be a more refined 
'search by calendar' function, include a user login feature (category: normal user vs moderator) and definitely to polish the user interface/ outlook.
